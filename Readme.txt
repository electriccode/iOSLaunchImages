Automate generation of iOS LaunchImages

Tired of generating iOS launch images at different resolutions? Try LaunchImageGenerator for iOS.

The package is bundled with two files.

GenerateLaunchImages.jsx
PSDLaunchImages.psd

Former is a script file and the latter is a photoshop document.
Copy both to any directory.

Double lick the “master copy” to edit the launch image contents in an separate psb file. Save and close psb. All launch images will get updated.
Open Photoshop. Go to “File > Scripts > Browse” and point it to the jsx file and let the magic happen for you.
All launch images are saved in the same directory.
jsx is nothing but a simple javascript file so you can read it and edit the compression settings of PNG, saved file names etc.
Enjoy :)
